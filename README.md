python-hawkdove
===============

A simulation of Hawk Dove game theory in python

NOTE: If you have pylab installed, at the end of the last round, a graph will be produced

To run:

<pre>
	> sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
</pre>

<pre>
	> chmod +x hawkdove.py
	> ./hawkdove.py
</pre>

<h3>Behavior with defaults:</h3>
Hawks dominate Doves completely. After round ~26, Doves die off and Hawks go into frenzy mode and wipe themselves out by round ~98.
